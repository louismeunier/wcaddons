## wcaddons

A Chrome extension that adds extra functionality to the WCA website (and more to come!)

This is still very heavily in development, and has not been publicly released yet. However, if you would like to use it yourself, you can download all the code and add it as a local extension at: `chrome://extensions`

Accreditation for all icons used throughout the extension is available at [src/images/README.md](src/images/README.md).

*Note:* I am not associated with the WCA in any way, shape, or form. Check out their website @ https://github.com/thewca

### current features

 - Compare a number of competitors against each other (~~in progress~~)
 - Compare Cstimer results to your official results, in real time! (NOTE: this feature assumes that your first average is ao5, or mo3 for other events. May be enhanced in the future.)
